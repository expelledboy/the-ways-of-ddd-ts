# The Ways of doing DDD in Typescript

In this repo we will be exploring the various approaches to Domain Driven Design in Typescript.

This doesn't teach you how to do DDD, but rather tries to find the most succulent syntax
that fully utilizes Typescripts type system to highlight impossible states, and
the minimal necessary functionality that satisfies the requirements.

If you have a better approaches please contribute. Thank you!

See the `package.json` scripts to get started.
